**🎨 Skittles Color Sorting Device**

<br/>

__📌 Overview__

This project is a **low-cost, portable, and accessible** candy color sorting device designed to automatically sort Skittles into five colors: **Red, Yellow, Green, Orange, and Purple**.
A key design goal was **accessibility**, the device can be used by **color-blind and visually impaired users**, featuring **engraved labels and Braille markings** for each output compartment.

<br/>

__🚀 Key Features:__

- ✅ Sorts 5 colors (Red, Yellow, Green, Orange, Purple)

- 🎯 99% accuracy across 100 trials

- ⏱ Fast operation (~3 seconds per Skittle)

- ♿ Accessible design (Braille + engraved labels)

- 🔋 Fully portable (battery-powered)

- 🧩 Modular & serviceable (17 custom 3D-printed parts)

  <br/>

__🛠️ System Architecture__

__Hardware components__

- Arduino Uno – main controller

- TCS3200 RGB Color Sensor – color detection

- MG996R Servo Motor – candy transport disc

- S51 Micro Servo – ramp positioning

- Vibration Motors – clog prevention

- Power Supply

  - 4× AA batteries (servos)

  - 9V battery + buck converter (Arduino)


__Mechanical Design__

- Wooden base for lightweight structure and laser engraving

- Large funnel capacity (~50 Skittles)

- Five individual storage compartments

- 17 custom 3D-printed parts (PLA)

<br/>

__🧠 How It Works__

1. Candy is dropped into the funnel

2. A rotating disc moves the Skittle to the sensing position

3. The TCS3200 sensor takes multiple RGB readings

4. The rotating disc aligns the Skittle with the ramp opening
   
6. A servo-controlled ramp guides the candy into the correct bin

7. System resets for the next cycle
